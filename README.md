# Shell
A Unix shell written in C.

# Build Instructions
Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/CianOSullivan/Shell
```

To run the shell:

```
cd Shell
make
./csh
```

The shell will then be executing! The shell can be run through a terminal emulator just as any other. For example, to use csh as the shell in urxvt, run the following:

```
urxvt -e /path/to/csh-executable
```
